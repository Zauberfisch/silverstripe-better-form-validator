# SilverStripe Form Validator

## Work in progress

This module is still work in progress.
This module exists because of missing features in SilverStripe and might 
change its API or be completely obsolete once similar functionality is 
provided by SilverStripe.

## Installation

#### Installing the module

1. Install the module using composer or download and place in your project folder
2. Run `?flush=1`

## Usage

```php
$fields = new FieldList([
	new TextField('Name', _t('MyForm.Name', 'Name')),
	new CheckboxField('CallMe', _t('MyForm.CallMe', 'Do you want us to call you on your phone number?')),
	new TextField('Phone', _t('MyForm.Phone', 'Phone')),
	new EmailField('Email', _t('MyForm.Email', 'Email')),
	new TextareaField('Message', _t('MyForm.Message', 'Message')),
]);

$actions = new FieldList([
	new FormAction('SubmitMyForm', _t('MyForm.Submit', 'Submit')),
]);

$validateCallback = function ($data, Form $form, LambdaValidator $validator) {
	// using $valid is currently optional because a form is automatically 
	// considered invalid if there are any error messages 
	$valid = true;

	if (isset($data['CallMe']) && $data['CallMe']) {
		// if the call me checkbox is ticked, then a phone number is required
		if ($validator->requireField('Phone')) {
			$valid = false;
		}
		// requireField will automatically add an error message to the form and set it as invalid
	}

	if (isset($data['Message'])) {
		// Message is automatically required, but this code will still run even if its not set
		// so we have to check that it's set
		if (stripos($data['Message'], 'viagra') !== false && stripos($data['Message'], 'cheap')) {
			$valid = false;
			$validator->validationError(
				// fieldName
				'Message', 
				// message
				_t(
					'MyForm.NoViagra',
					'Sorry, but we are currently not looking for cheap Viagra'
				),
				// message type and css class
				'required' 
			);
		}
	}

	return $valid;
};

$validator = new LambdaValidator(
	// Parameter 1 - php callable to perform custom validation
	$validateCallback, 
	// Parameter 2 - boolean or array|FieldList of fields to validate
	// In this case boolean true to automatically validate all fields
	// Validate means check for correct value for a type, eg EmailField 
	// is valid if its empty or if a valid email address is entered
	true,  
	// Parameter 3 - boolean or array|FieldList of fields that are required (can not be empty)
	['Name', 'Email', 'Message']
);

// the above code can be in your own Form subclass or used in combination with the line below
$form = new Form($controller, $name, $fields, $actions, $validator);
```
